# JRNY - Chat Restart Instructions

## 🚨 **READ THIS FIRST** - Current Status: WORKING PERFECTLY

**Last Updated**: July 5, 2025  
**Status**: All core features functional, Strava integration working flawlessly

## 📋 **Quick Context for New Chats**

### **Opening Statement (Copy/Paste This):**
```
I'm continuing work on my JRNY marathon training app. The core functionality is working perfectly - Strava integration, activity display, authentication, etc. are all functional. I need help with [specific new feature/issue]. Here's the current status file...
```

### **Key Points - What's WORKING (DON'T TOUCH):**
- ✅ **Strava OAuth & API integration** - 28+ activities syncing correctly
- ✅ **Activity display** - Shows real activity names, distances, Strava links
- ✅ **Date matching** - Activities appear on correct training days
- ✅ **Multiple activities per day** - Handles multiple runs per day
- ✅ **Authentication system** - Login/logout working
- ✅ **Database operations** - All Supabase tables and queries working
- ✅ **UI/UX** - Beautiful Valencia Marathon theme, mobile responsive

### **Recent Critical Fix (DON'T UNDO):**
**Problem**: Activities had `type: undefined` causing display issues  
**Solution**: Removed type filtering in `generateWeekData()` function  
**Code**: Changed `return activityDate === dateStr && activity.type === 'Run';` to `return activityDate === dateStr;`

## 🎯 **Focus Areas for New Development:**

### **High Priority:**
- Enhanced progress analytics dashboard
- Training plan creation/editing interface
- OCR plan import from images
- Pace analysis and trends

### **Medium Priority:**
- Race prediction features
- Advanced session customization
- Coach sharing functionality
- Export capabilities

### **Low Priority:**
- Additional integrations (Garmin, etc.)
- Social features
- Advanced analytics

## 🚫 **What NOT to Do:**

- ❌ Don't re-debug the Strava integration (it's working)
- ❌ Don't change the activity display logic (it's working)
- ❌ Don't modify the authentication flow (it's working)
- ❌ Don't touch the database schema (it's working)
- ❌ Don't "fix" things that aren't broken

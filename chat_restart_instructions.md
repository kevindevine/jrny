## 🚫 **What NOT to Do:**

- ❌ Don't modify the authentication flow (it's working)
- ❌ Don't touch the database schema (it's working)
- ❌ Don't "fix" the editable race overview (it's working perfectly)
- ❌ Don't modify the onboarding flow (it's been optimized)

## 📁 **Key Working Components:**
1. **RaceOverview.tsx** - Editable race details with dynamic week calculation
2. **TrainingDashboard.tsx** - Main training timeline with Strava integration
3. **page.tsx** (dashboard) - Onboarding flow and authentication 
4. **API routes** - All CRUD operations for training blocks
5. **Strava integration** - OAuth and activity syncing

## 🔧 **Quick Start Commands:**
```bash
cd jrny
npm run dev
# App loads on http://localhost:3000
# Everything should work immediately
```

## 🆘 **If Something Breaks:**
1. **First**: Check if you accidentally modified working code
2. **Git reset**: `git checkout -- [filename]` to restore working version
